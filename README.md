- The player can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).

- If the player goes over 21, they "Bust" and lose the game.
- The dealer must hit if their hand value is less than 17, and stand if their hand is 17 or more.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points depending on the player's hand.
- The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s, or if the dealer busts.
